# Spectrum analysis of the Crab pulsar with the Fermi LAT

Construction and comparison of the theoritical and experimental SED in high energy

This repository records all the process and the tools to perform the construction and the theoritical confrontation of the spectral energy density of the Crab pulsar (J0534+2200) in a field of observation about 5° and 20° with the Fermi LAT as part of an internship in the [astroparticles research group](https://www.lp2ib.in2p3.fr/astro-neutrino/astroparticules/) at the [LP2I/CENBG](https://www.lp2ib.in2p3.fr).

## Requirements

You must have the [FermiBottle container](https://github.com/fermi-lat/FermiBottle) using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and have access to [the official Fermi website](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/)


## Usage

All the process is detailed in the attached [notebook](./analysis.ipynb)
